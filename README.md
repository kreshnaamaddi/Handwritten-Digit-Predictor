# Handwritten-Digit-Predictor
MNIST is a dataset of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9), each 28x28 pixels. It is widely used for training and benchmarking machine learning models in digit recognition. ðŸš€



# Handwritten Digit Classification

## Overview
This project implements a Handwritten Digit Classification model using deep learning. It utilizes a neural network to classify digits from 0 to 9 based on the MNIST dataset. The project showcases the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in image recognition tasks.

## Features
- Preprocessing of handwritten digit images
- Model training using TensorFlow/Keras
- Evaluation of model accuracy on test data
- Visualization of training and validation loss/accuracy
- Prediction on custom handwritten digits

## Installation
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
```
You may also need Jupyter Notebook if you plan to run the project interactively:
```bash
pip install notebook
```

## Usage
To execute the model training and evaluation, open the Jupyter Notebook and run the cells step by step:
```bash
jupyter notebook Handwritten_Digit_Classification.ipynb
```
Alternatively, you can convert the notebook into a Python script and run it as follows:
```bash
python Handwritten_Digit_Classification.py
```

## Dataset
The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, which consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits (0-9). The dataset is preprocessed to normalize pixel values between 0 and 1.

## Model Architecture
The deep learning model follows a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) approach:
- **Input Layer**: 28x28 grayscale images
- **Convolutional Layers**: Extract features using filters
- **Pooling Layers**: Downsample feature maps
- **Fully Connected Layers**: Classify the extracted features into digit classes
- **Activation Functions**: ReLU for hidden layers, Softmax for the output layer

## Training
The model is trained using:
- **Loss Function**: Categorical Crossentropy
- **Optimizer**: Adam optimizer for efficient learning
- **Evaluation Metric**: Accuracy score
- **Epochs**: Configurable based on computational resources

## Results
The trained model achieves high accuracy in classifying handwritten digits. Accuracy and loss curves are plotted for analysis. 
- Expected Test Accuracy: ~98%
- Model Performance: Robust on standard digit inputs

## Custom Predictions
You can test the model on custom handwritten digits:
1. Provide an image of a digit.
2. Preprocess the image (resize, normalize).
3. Use the trained model to predict the digit.
4. Display the prediction results.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement data augmentation to improve generalization.
- Explore different CNN architectures such as ResNet or EfficientNet.
- Deploy the model as a web application using Flask or Streamlit.
